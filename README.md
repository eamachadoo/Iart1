"Even More Pizza" is an artificial intelligence project that addresses an optimization problem for pizza delivery to teams. The goal is to intelligently assign available pizzas with different ingredients to teams of varying sizes (2, 3, or 4 people) to maximize the total number of distinct ingredients delivered across all teams.
