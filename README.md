"Even More Pizza" is an artificial intelligence project that addresses an optimization problem for pizza delivery to teams. The goal is to intelligently assign available pizzas with different ingredients to teams of varying sizes (2, 3, or 4 people) to maximize the total number of distinct ingredients delivered across all teams.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language: Java

    Algorithms: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm

    Data Structures: HashMap, List, HashSet for managing pizzas, ingredients, teams, and deliveries

    Optimization Techniques: Various heuristics including pizza swapping between deliveries and with unused pizzas

    Search Methods: Random search, greedy search, and multiple metaheuristic approaches

The project involved formulating the problem as a search problem, implementing multiple optimization algorithms, and conducting comparative analysis to determine the most effective approach for maximizing ingredient diversity in team pizza assignments.
